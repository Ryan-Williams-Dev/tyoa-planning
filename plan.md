# Take Your Own Advice (Working Title)

## The Premise

I thoroughly believe we should all treat ourselves like we are our own best friend, but too often we find ourselves as our biggest critics.

I feel like I offer great advice, but I can slack at following those same priciples myself. I can't be the only one who deals with this.

This application aims to tackle this. My initial vision is an application which prompts you thorughout the week, perhaps daily, and will inquire as to your current mood. For example, if you are feeling a positive emotion such as excited, proud, or loved the application will ask you something like "What would you say to someone who was feeling innadequate/shameful/depressed right now?". If you responded to the prompt saying you were feeling a negative emotion, the app will pull one of your previous advices and face you with your own words.
